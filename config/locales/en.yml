      status and this food benefit, more information is available <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__covid19.ca.gov_img_wp_covid-2D19-2Dimmigrant-2Dguidance-2Daccessible-2D1.pdf&d=DwMFAg&c=uASjV29gZuJt5_5J5CPRuQ&r=8R-cSKwMRKVQ8RlrsVEwub2ambB3pAUafrkOocCUwuw&m=zPw4azKOYZF_a34l3RNTMWy3ZGnar6BxiYo2of5MC20&s=C5kfHk9vuZa85KToIulnjpsTdZk8hH7VIz4PiTWGyx4&e"
