    if_i_get_answer_2_html: In addition, free and reduced-price school meals are not considered public benefits for public charge purposes. Additionally, benefits received by children do not count against their parents for public charge purposes. Children are the recipients of P-EBT, so it won’t be considered as a benefit received by their parents.
    if_i_get_answer_3_html: Public charge does not apply to all immigrants. If you have questions about your immigration
      status and this food benefit, more information is available <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__covid19.ca.gov_img_wp_covid-2D19-2Dimmigrant-2Dguidance-2Daccessible-2D1.pdf&d=DwMFAg&c=uASjV29gZuJt5_5J5CPRuQ&r=8R-cSKwMRKVQ8RlrsVEwub2ambB3pAUafrkOocCUwuw&m=zPw4azKOYZF_a34l3RNTMWy3ZGnar6BxiYo2of5MC20&s=C5kfHk9vuZa85KToIulnjpsTdZk8hH7VIz4PiTWGyx4&e"

      CalWORKs, Medi-Cal, or Foster Care benefits we may not have your most recent address. Do NOT apply online to
      report a change of address. Instead, you can call the EBT Customer Service Center
